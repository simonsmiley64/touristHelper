### Notes

- The Tourist Helper brief states that 100 nearby locations should be retrieved. Unfortunately Google Maps API only allows you to pull 60 nearby locations with 20 downloading at a time. This meant that there is room in the market for a Tourist Helper 100 which would allow tourists to download even more nearby locations. This being said TouristHelper has been developed to quickly scale up if more locations are available for download meaning the code structure is in place to allow for more locations.
